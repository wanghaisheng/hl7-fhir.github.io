  "requirements": "Scope and Usage Appointment resources are used to provide information about a planned meeting that may be in the future or past. They may be for a single meeting or for a series of repeating visits. Examples include a scheduled surgery, a follow-up for a clinical visit, a scheduled conference call between clinicians to discuss a case, the reservation of a piece of diagnostic equipment for a particular use, etc. The visit scheduled by an appointment may be in person or remote (by phone, video conference, etc.) All that matters is that the time and usage of one or more individuals, locations and/or pieces of equipment is being fully or partially reserved for a designated period of time. \r\n\r\nThis definition takes the concepts of appointments in a clinical setting and also extends them to be relevant in the community healthcare space, and also ease exposure to other appointment / calendar standards widely used outside of Healthcare. \r\n\r\nThe basic workflow to create an appointment * Discovery/Addressing The discovery process covers that actual finding of the resource that we want to schedule an appointment with. This includes the addressing information that is required, and any formatting information which indicates how to make the request. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Checking Availability (optional) This optional step permits the checking of any existing available times that can be booked against. Just because a time is indicated it is available doesn't guarantee that an appointment can be made. The booking system that is going to receive the request may make other qualifying decisions to determine if the appointment can be made, such as permissions, assessments, availability of other resources etc. \r\n\r\nThis step is optional as the creation of the appointment is never a guaranteed action. But by performing this availability check, you can increase the chances of making a successful booking. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Making the Appointment Request The request is performed by posting an Appointment to the address found during discovery. This will have a needs-action status for each of the participants. (The system that receives the request may modify the status of any posted appointment based on internal business rules, such as certain users do not have permission to request certain appointments) \r\n\r\n\r\n* Replying to the request The reply process is simply performed by the person/system handing the requests updating the Participant Statuses as needed. If there are multiple systems involved, then these will create AppointmentResponse entries with the desired statuses. \r\n\r\nOnce all participants have their participation status created/updated (and the main system marking the appointment participant records with the AppointmentResponse statuses) then the overall status of the appointment is updated. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Checking the overall status (Requester) The Requester (organizer) of the appointment checks for the overall status of the appointment (and appointmentresponses where applicable) using fhir pub-sub techniques. \r\n\r\nWhere the participant statuses indicate that a re-scheduling is required, then the process may start again, with other systems replying to a new set of times. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 2 typical workflows that occur with appointments * Outlook Style - Community These types of requests are typically handled by selecting a specific time\r\n\r\n\r\n* Hospital Scheduling - Clinical",
