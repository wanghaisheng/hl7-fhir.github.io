A few observations (e.g. apgar store) may have both a value and related observations (for apgar, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.name. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.name defines a coded value. The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (The name format is \"'value' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).",
