The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.\nThese concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal &quot;030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455&quot;.  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes.\nMembers of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.

They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal \"030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455\".  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes.  Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held."}]},{"code":"ObservationInterpretationDetection","abstract":true,"display":"ObservationInterpretationDetection","definition":"Interpretations of the presence or absence of a component / analyte or organism in a test or of a sign in a clinical observation.
