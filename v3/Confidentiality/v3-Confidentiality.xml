                           Examples: Includes anonymized, pseudonymized, or non-personally identifiable information such as HIPAA limited data sets.

                           Map: No clear map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (1) Care Management:   RECORD_COMPONENTs that might need to be accessed by a wide range of administrative staff to manage the subject of care&#39;s access to health services.
            <br/>

                        
                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates the receiver may have an obligation to comply with a data use agreement.

            <br/>

                        
                           Examples: Includes allergies of non-sensitive nature used inform food service; health information a patient authorizes to be used for marketing, released to a bank for a health credit card or savings account; or information in personal health record systems that are not governed under health privacy laws.
            <br/>

                        
                           Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (2) Clinical Management:  Less sensitive RECORD_COMPONENTs that might need to be accessed by a wider range of personnel not all of whom are actively caring for the patient (e.g. radiology staff).

            <br/>

                        
                           Examples: In the US, this includes what HIPAA identifies as the minimum necessary protected health information (PHI) given a covered purpose of use (treatment, payment, or operations).  Includes typical, non-stigmatizing health information disclosed in an application for health, workers compensation, disability, or life insurance.

Maps to normal confidentiality for treatment information but not to ancillary care, payment and operations.
