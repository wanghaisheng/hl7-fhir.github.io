The federal standards do not conceptually define ethnicity, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for ethnicity classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification.  The standards specify two minimum ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino.  The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of &quot;Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.&quot; The standards stipulate that ethnicity data need not be limited to the two minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.  In addition, the standards stipulate that an individual can be Hispanic or Latino or can be Not Hispanic or Latino, but cannot be both.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ExposureMode<a name=\"ExposureMode\"> </a></td><td>ExposureMode</td><td>\n                        Code for the mechanism by which the exposure agent was exchanged or potentially exchanged by the participants involved in the exposure.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>FDDC<a name=\"FDDC\"> </a></td><td>First DataBank Drug Codes</td><td>\n                        National Drug Data File.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.<br/>\r\n\n                        Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.<br/>\r\n\n                        As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.<br/>\r\n\n                        The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.<br/>\r\n\n                        ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary. Therefore Terms that are directly authorized by the RDD Registration Authority neither define nor prescribe intellectual property rights or other legal entities.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ISO3166-1<a name=\"ISO3166-1\"> </a></td><td>ISO 3166 2 Character Country Codes</td><td>\n                        Two character country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ISO3166-2<a name=\"ISO3166-2\"> </a></td><td>ISO 3166 3 Character Country Codes</td><td>\n                        Three character country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ISO3166-3<a name=\"ISO3166-3\"> </a></td><td>ISO 3166 Numeric country Codes</td><td>\n                        Numeric country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ISO4217<a name=\"ISO4217\"> </a></td><td>ISO4217</td><td>\n                        ISO 4217 currency code<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>IUPC<a name=\"IUPC\"> </a></td><td>IUPAC/IFCC Component Codes</td><td>\n                        Codes used by IUPAC/IFF to identify the component (analyte) measured.

The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from &quot;the original peoples&quot; of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>RC<a name=\"RC\"> </a></td><td>Read Classification</td><td>\n                        The Read Clinical Classification of Medicine, Park View Surgery, 26 Leicester Rd., Loughborough LE11 2AG (includes drug procedure and other codes, as well as diagnostic codes).<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>RCFB<a name=\"RCFB\"> </a></td><td>The Read Codes Four Byte Set:</td><td>\n                        The Read Codes Four Byte Set consists of 4 alphanumeric characters.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.\r\n\n                        Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.\r\n\n                        As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.\r\n\n                        The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.\r\n\n                        ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary.
