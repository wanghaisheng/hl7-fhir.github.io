As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication.

For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the  &quot;ST elevation&quot; observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode.  Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a &quot;1st degree burn&quot;, the relation &quot;has bounded support&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;SUBJ<a name=\"SUBJ\"> </a></td><td>has subject</td><td>\n                        Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.<br/>\r\n\n                        Examples<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              The first Act may be a ControlAct manipulating the subject Act <br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a reporting or notification Act, that echos the subject Act for a specific new purpose.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                        \n                        Constraints<br/>\r\n\n                        An Act may have multiple subject acts.<br/>\r\n\n                        Rationale<br/>\r\n\n                        The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>3</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUALF<a name=\"QUALF\"> </a></td><td>has qualifier</td><td>\n                        The target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNote: This is not intended to replace concept refinement and qualification via vocabulary.
