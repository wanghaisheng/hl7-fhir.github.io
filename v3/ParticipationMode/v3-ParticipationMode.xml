      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
                  A set of codes specifying the modality by which the Entity playing the Role is participating in the Act.
        <br/>

                  
                     Examples: Physically present, over the telephone, written communication. 
        <br/>

                  
                     Rationale: Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.
