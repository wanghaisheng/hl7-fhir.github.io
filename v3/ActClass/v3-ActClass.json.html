Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a &amp;quot;statement&amp;quot; according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but &amp;quot;a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.&amp;quot; Rector and Nowlan go on saying that &amp;quot;the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.&amp;quot; Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as &amp;quot;speech-acts&amp;quot; in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category &amp;quot;sequel&amp;quot;).&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent &amp;quot;objective state of affairs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;real processes&amp;quot; independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=\&quot;color: grey\&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(_ActClassRecordOrganizer)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a name=\&quot;_ActClassRecordOrganizer\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        Used to group a set of acts sharing a common context. Organizer structures can nest within other context structures - such as where a document is contained within a folder, or a folder is contained within an EHR extract.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;COMPOSITION&lt;a name=\&quot;COMPOSITION\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;composition&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A context representing a grouped commitment of information to the EHR. It is considered the unit of modification of the record, the unit of transmission in record extracts, and the unit of attestation by authorizing clinicians.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        A composition represents part of a patient record originating from a single interaction between an authenticator and the record.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Unless otherwise stated all statements within a composition have the same authenticator, apply to the same patient and were recorded in a single session of use of a single application.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        A composition contains organizers and entries.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DOC&lt;a name=\&quot;DOC\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;document&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        The notion of a document comes particularly from the paper world, where it corresponds to the contents recorded on discrete pieces of paper. In the electronic world, a document is a kind of composition that bears resemblance to their paper world counter-parts. Documents typically are meant to be human-readable.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        HL7's notion of document differs from that described in the W3C XML Recommendation, in which a document refers specifically to the contents that fall between the root element's start-tag and end-tag. Not all XML documents are HL7 documents.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DOCCLIN&lt;a name=\&quot;DOCCLIN\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;clinical document&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A clinical document is a documentation of clinical observations and services, with the following characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Persistence - A clinical document continues to exist in an unaltered state, for a time period defined by local and regulatory requirements; &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Stewardship - A clinical document is maintained by a person or organization entrusted with its care; &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Potential for authentication - A clinical document is an assemblage of information that is intended to be legally authenticated; &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Wholeness - Authentication of a clinical document applies to the whole and does not apply to portions of the document without the full context of the document;&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Human readability - A clinical document is human readable.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                        \n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CDALVLONE&lt;a name=\&quot;CDALVLONE\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CDA Level One clinical document&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A clinical document that conforms to Level One of the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CONTAINER&lt;a name=\&quot;CONTAINER\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;record container&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        \n                           Description: Container of clinical statements. Navigational. No semantic content. Knowledge of the section code is not required to interpret contained observations. Represents a heading in a heading structure, or &amp;quot;container tree&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        The record entries relating to a single clinical session are usually grouped under headings that represent phases of the encounter, or assist with layout and navigation. Clinical headings usually reflect the clinical workflow during a care session, and might also reflect the main author's reasoning processes. Much research has demonstrated that headings are used differently by different professional groups and specialties, and that headings are not used consistently enough to support safe automatic processing of the E H R.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CATEGORY&lt;a name=\&quot;CATEGORY\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;category&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A group of entries within a composition or topic that have a common characteristic - for example, Examination, Diagnosis, Management OR Subjective, Objective, Analysis, Plan.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        The distinction from Topic relates to value sets. For Category there is a bounded list of things like &amp;quot;Examination&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Diagnosis&amp;quot; or SOAP categories. For Topic the list is wide open to any clinical condition or reason for a part of an encounter.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        A CATEGORY MAY CONTAIN ENTRIES.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DOCBODY&lt;a name=\&quot;DOCBODY\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;document body&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A context that distinguishes the body of a document from the document header. This is seen, for instance, in HTML documents, which have discrete &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; elements.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DOCSECT&lt;a name=\&quot;DOCSECT\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;document section&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A context that subdivides the body of a document. Document sections are typically used for human navigation, to give a reader a clue as to the expected content. Document sections are used to organize and provide consistency to the contents of a document body. Document sections can contain document sections and can contain entries.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;TOPIC&lt;a name=\&quot;TOPIC\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;topic&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A group of entries within a composition that are related to a common clinical theme - such as a specific disorder or problem, prevention, screening and provision of contraceptive services.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        A topic may contain categories and entries. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EXTRACT&lt;a name=\&quot;EXTRACT\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;extract&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        This context represents the part of a patient record conveyed in a single communication.

The creation of a PublicHealthCase initiates the tracking of the object of concern.  The decision to track is related to but somewhat independent of the underlying event or observation.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: Typically a Public Health Case involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OUTBR&lt;a name=\&quot;OUTBR\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;outbreak&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        An Outbreak is a concern resulting from a series of public health cases.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: The date on which an outbreak starts is the earliest date of onset among the cases assigned to the outbreak and its ending date is the last date of onset among the cases assigned to the outbreak. The effectiveTime attribute is used to convey the relevant dates for the case. An outbreak definition (Act.moodCode = &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot; includes the criteria for the number, types and occurrence pattern of cases necessary to declare an outbreak and to judge the severity of an outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CONS&lt;a name=\&quot;CONS\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;consent&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        The &amp;quot;signatures&amp;quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of &amp;quot;performer&amp;quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and &amp;quot;consenter&amp;quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Some consent has a minimum required delay between the consent and the service, so as to allow the patient to rethink his decisions. This minimum delay can be expressed in the act definition by the ActRelationship.pauseQuantity attribute that delays the service until the pause time has elapsed after the consent has been completed.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CONTREG&lt;a name=\&quot;CONTREG\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;container registration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        An Act where a container is registered either via an automated sensor, such as a barcode reader,  or by manual receipt&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;CTTEVENT&lt;a name=\&quot;CTTEVENT\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;clinical trial timepoint event&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        An identified point during a clinical trial at which one or more actions are scheduled to be performed (definition mood), or are actually performed (event mood).

Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in.  As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB.  Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period.  There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes.  The substance administrations are only hypotheses until confirmed by further testing.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              A patient who has received an elective total hip replacement procedure suffers a prolonged stay in hospital, due to contracting an MRSA infection in the surgical wound site after the surgery. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is an exposure to MRSA.

As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients.  Although there are substance administrations involving the application of the detergent to the skin of the patients, it is expected that the substance administrations would not be directly documented.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              Seven patients who are residents in a health care facility for the elderly mentally ill have developed respiratory problems. After several months of various tests having been performed and various medications prescribed to these patients, the problem is traced to their being &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot; to a new fungicide used in the wall plaster of the ward where these patients reside.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide.  Although there have been continuous substance administrations (via breathing) this would not normally be documented as a substance administration.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              A patient with osteoarthritis of the knees is treated symptomatically using analgesia, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g up to four times a day for pain relief.  His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.  The exposure component is based on the relative toxic level of the substance to a patient with a compromised liver function.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              A patient goes to their GP complaining of abdominal pain, having been discharged from the local hospital ten days' previously after an emergency appendectomy.  The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is a procedural sequelae.

They are hurrying down the second floor corridor.  A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor.  In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is not an exposure.

The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:\n                        &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Recording the results of a Family History Assessment&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Laboratory test and associated result&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Physical exam test and associated result&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Device temperature&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Soil lead level&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                           \n                        \n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=\&quot;color: grey\&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(_ActClassROI)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a name=\&quot;_ActClassROI\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        Regions of Interest (ROI) within a subject Act. Primarily used for making secondary observations on a subset of a subject observation. The relationship between a ROI and its referenced Act is specified through an ActRelationship of type &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; (SUBJ), which must always be present.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ROIBND&lt;a name=\&quot;ROIBND\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bounded ROI&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A Region of Interest (ROI) specified for a multidimensional observation, such as an Observation Series (OBSSER). The ROI is specified using a set of observation criteria, each delineating the boundary of the region in one of the dimensions in the multidimensional observation. The relationship between a ROI and its referenced Act is specified through an ActRelationship of type subject (SUBJ), which must always be present. Each of the boundary criteria observations is connected with the ROI using ActRelationships of type &amp;quot;has component&amp;quot; (COMP). In each boundary criterion, the Act.code names the dimension and the Observation.value specifies the range of values inside the region. Typically the bounded dimension is continuous, and so the Observation.value will be an interval (IVL) data type. The Observation.value need not be specified if the respective dimension is only named but not constrained. For example, an ROI for the QT interval of a certain beat in ECG Lead II would contain 2 boundary criteria, one naming the interval in time (constrained), and the other naming the interval in ECG Lead II (only named, but not constrained).&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ROIOVL&lt;a name=\&quot;ROIOVL\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;overlay ROI&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        A Region of Interest (ROI) specified for an image using an overlay shape. Typically used to make reference to specific regions in images, e.g., to specify the location of a radiologic finding in an image or to specify the site of a physical finding by &amp;quot;circling&amp;quot; a region in a schematic picture of a human body. The units of the coordinate values are in pixels.  The origin is in the upper left hand corner, with positive X values going to the right and positive Y values going down. The relationship between a ROI and its referenced Act is specified through an ActRelationship of type &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; (SUBJ), which must always be present.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=\&quot;color: grey\&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(_SubjectPhysicalPosition)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a name=\&quot;_SubjectPhysicalPosition\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        The spatial relationship of a subject whether human, other animal, or plant, to a frame of reference such as gravity or a collection device.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr style=\&quot;background: #EFEFEF\&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=\&quot;color: grey\&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(_SubjectBodyPosition)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deprecated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a name=\&quot;_SubjectBodyPosition\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        Contains codes for defining the observed, physical position of a subject, such as during an observation, assessment, collection of a specimen, etc.  ECG waveforms and vital signs, such as blood pressure, are two examples where a general, observed position typically needs to be noted.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Deprecation Comment: \n                           This concept has been deprecated because it does not describe a type of Act (as it should in the ActClass code system), but rather encodes the result or value of an observation.

These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are run together because of automation. A battery can define required and optional component observations and, in some cases, will define complex rules that determine whether or not a particular observation is made.

Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr style=\&quot;background: #EFEFEF\&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;OUTB&lt;a name=\&quot;OUTB\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deprecated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;outbreak&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        An outbreak represents a series of public health cases.

With general Supply Acts, the precise identification of the Material (manufacturer, serial numbers, etc.) is important.  Most of the detailed information about the Supply should be represented using the Material class.  If delivery needs to be scheduled, tracked, and billed separately, one can associate a Transportation Act with the Supply Act.  Pharmacy dispense services are represented as Supply Acts, associated with a SubstanceAdministration  Act. The SubstanceAdministration class represents the administration of medication, while dispensing is supply.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\n                     &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n &lt;tr style=\&quot;background: #EFEFEF\&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;DIET&lt;a name=\&quot;DIET\&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deprecated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;diet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n                        Diet services are supply services, with some aspects resembling Medication services: the detail of the diet is given as a description of the Material associated via Participation.typeCode=&amp;quot;product&amp;quot;.

        &quot;display&quot;: &quot;act&quot;,
        &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;A record of something that is being done, has been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:The kinds of acts that are common in health care are (1) a clinical observation, (2) an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), (3) healthcare goals, (4) treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), (5) assisting, monitoring or attending, (6) training and education services to patients and their next of kin, (7) and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will), (8)  editing and maintaining documents, and many others.\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion and Rationale: Acts are the pivot of the RIM; all domain information and processes are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who \&quot;owns\&quot; the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a \&quot;statement\&quot; according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but \&quot;a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.\&quot; Rector and Nowlan go on saying that \&quot;the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.\&quot; Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as \&quot;speech-acts\&quot; in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category \&quot;sequel\&quot;).\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent \&quot;objective state of affairs\&quot; or \&quot;real processes\&quot; independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.&quot;,

                &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;A public health case is a Concern about an observation or event that has a specific significance for public health. The creation of a PublicHealthCase initiates the tracking of the object of concern.

The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health.\r\n\n                        A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = \&quot;definition\&quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment.

Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act.\r\n\n                        The \&quot;signatures\&quot; to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of \&quot;performer\&quot;, the healthcare provider informing the patient, and \&quot;consenter\&quot;, the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.\r\n\n                        Some consent has a minimum required delay between the consent and the service, so as to allow the patient to rethink his decisions. This minimum delay can be expressed in the act definition by the ActRelationship.pauseQuantity attribute that delays the service until the pause time has elapsed after the consent has been completed.&quot;

Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in.  As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB.  Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period.  There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes.

As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the \&quot;clean\&quot; bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients.

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is a procedural sequelae.

A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor.  In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee. \r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is not an exposure.

SBADM states that the criterion is the presence of a performer-but there are examples above that call this criterion into question (e.g., the first one, concerning a dosing error).&quot;,

            &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;Description:An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:\n                        \r\n\n                        Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.\r\n\n                        As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. \r\n\n                        The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.\r\n\n                        An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.\r\n\n                        Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. \r\n\n                        Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. \r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Recording the results of a Family History Assessment\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Laboratory test and associated result\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Physical exam test and associated result\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Device temperature\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Soil lead level&quot;,

In each boundary criterion, the Act.code names the dimension and the Observation.value specifies the range of values inside the region. Typically the bounded dimension is continuous, and so the Observation.value will be an interval (IVL) data type. The Observation.value need not be specified if the respective dimension is only named but not constrained. For example, an ROI for the QT interval of a certain beat in ECG Lead II would contain 2 boundary criteria, one naming the interval in time (constrained), and the other naming the interval in ECG Lead II (only named, but not constrained).&quot;

These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are run together because of automation. A battery can define required and optional component observations and, in some cases, will define complex rules that determine whether or not a particular observation is made. BATTERY is a constraint on the Observation class in that it is understood to always be composed of component observations.\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: The focus in a BATTERY is that it is composed of individual observations.

                    &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;A public health case is an Observation representing a condition or event that has a specific significance for public health. Typically it involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. The public health case can include a health-related event concerning a single individual or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. An outbreak involving multiple individuals may be considered as a type of public health case. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = \&quot;definition\&quot;) includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment. Examples include AIDS, toxic-shock syndrome, and salmonellosis and their associated indicators that are used to define a case.&quot;,

Pharmacy dispense services are represented as Supply Acts, associated with a SubstanceAdministration  Act. The SubstanceAdministration class represents the administration of medication, while dispensing is supply.&quot;,
