      <h2>Compartment</h2>
      <p> A named tag set for metadata used to populate a security category label field that &quot;segments&quot; an IT resource per policy by indicating that access and use is restricted to members of a defined community or project. (HL7 Healthcare Privacy and Security Classification System)  Usage Note:
        <br/>This is the healthcare analog to the US Intelligence Community&#39;s concept of a Special Access Program.  Compartment codes may be used in as a field value in an initiator&#39;s clearance to indicate permission to access and use an IT Resource with a security label having the same compartment value in security category label field. Map: Aligns with ISO 2382-8 definition of Compartment -  &quot;A division of data into isolated blocks with separate security controls for the purpose of reducing risk.&quot; (OID = 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.20478)
