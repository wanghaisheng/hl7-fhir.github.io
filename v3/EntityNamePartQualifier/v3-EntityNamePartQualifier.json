They are used as patterns against which input name strings may be matched for automatic identification of products from input text reports.   While they cover the concepts held under \"doseForm\" or \"route\" or \"strength\" the name parts are not the same and do not fit into a controlled vocabulary in the same way. By specifying up to 8 name parts a much larger range of possible names can be generated.","concept":[{"code":"CON","display":"container name","definition":"Description: This refers to the container if present in the medicinal product name.\r\n\n                        EXAMPLES: \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              For Optaflu suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe Influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) (2007/2008 season): pre-filled syringe"},{"code":"DEV","display":"device name","definition":"Description: This refers to the qualifiers in the name for devices and is at the moment mainly applicable to insulins and inhalation products.\r\n\n                        EXAMPLES: \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              For the medicinal product Actrapid FlexPen 100 IU/ml Solution for injection Subcutaneous use: FlexPen."},{"code":"FLAV","display":"FlavorName","definition":"Description: This refers to a flavor of the medicinal product if present in the medicinal product name.\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        \r\n\n                        \n                           For 'CoughCure Linctus Orange Flavor', the flavor part is \"Orange\"\n                           For 'Wonderdrug Syrup Cherry Flavor', the flavor part is \"Cherry\""},{"code":"FORMUL","display":"FormulationPartName","definition":"Description: This refers to the formulation of the medicinal product if present in the medicinal product name.\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        \r\n\n                        \n                           For 'SpecialMed Sugar Free Cough Syrup', the formulation name part is \"Sugar Free\"\n                           For 'QuickCure Gluten-free Bulk Fibre', the formulation name part is \"gluten-free\""},{"code":"FRM","display":"form name","definition":"Description: This refers to the pharmaceutical form/ if present in the medicinal product name.\r\n\n                        EXAMPLES: \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              For Agenerase 50 mg soft capsules: Soft Capsules\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              For Ludiomil 25mg-Filmtabletten: Filmtabletten\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              For Optaflu suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe Influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) (2007/2008 season): suspension for injection"},{"code":"INV","display":"invented name","definition":"Description: This refers to the product name without the trademark or the name of the marketing authorization holder or any other descriptor reflected in the product name and, if appropriate, whether it is intended e.g. for babies, children or adults. \r\n\n                        EXAMPLES: \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Agenerase\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Optaflu\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Ludiomil"},{"code":"POPUL","display":"TargetPopulationName","definition":"Description: This refers to the target population for the medicinal product if present in the medicinal product name\r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        \r\n\n                        \n                           For 'Broncho-Drug 3.5 mg-capsules for children', the target population part is \"children\"\n                           For 'Adult Chesty Cough Syrup', the target population part is \"adult\""},{"code":"SCI","display":"scientific name","definition":"Description: This refers to the product common or scientific name without the trademark or the name of the marketing authorization holder or any other descriptor reflected in the product name.\r\n\n                        EXAMPLES: \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              For Agenerase: N/A\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              For Optaflu: Influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell culture) (2007/2008 season)\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              For Ludiomil: N/A"},{"code":"STR","display":"strength name","definition":"Description: This refers to the strength if present in the medicinal product name.
