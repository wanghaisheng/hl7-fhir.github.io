                        A physician is a person qualified by a doctorate in medicine (M.D.) or osteopathy (D.O.), licensed by the state, and practicing within the scope of that license. A physician generally has primary responsibility for the health care of the patient. While M.D.s and D.O.s may use all accepted methods of treatment, including drugs and surgery, D.O.s place special emphasis on the body&#39;s musculoskeletal systems.

These health services include a wide variety of medical treatments and consults, inpatient and outpatient hospitalization, home health service, ambulance service, and sometimes dental and pharmacy services.
