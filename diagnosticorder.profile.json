  "requirements": "Scope and Usage A Diagnostic Order is a record of a request for a set of diagnostic investigations to be performed. The investigation will lead to a Diagnostic Report that summarizes the outcome of the investigation, and includes any useful data and/or images that are relevant to the treatment/management of the subject. \r\n\r\nThe principal intention of the Diagnostic Order is to support ordering diagnostic investigations on patients (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However in many contexts, healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic investigations on groups of subjects, devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts, bodies of water, etc. The Diagnostic Order supports all these usages. \r\n\r\nThe general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a diagnostic order. The diagnostic order is then exchanged, perhaps via intermediaries, with a system that represents a diagnostic service that can perform the investigation as a request to do so. The diagnostic service will update the request as the work is performed, and then finally issue a report that references the requests that it fulfills.",
